#  Churn Prediction & Survival Analysis Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using **classification models** and estimating customer retention over time with **survival analysis models**.  
Both models are deployed in a **Flask-based interactive dashboard** where users can upload customer data and view predictions, insights, and recommendations.  

The dashboard consists of four main tabs:  
1. **Overview** – Business insights, KPIs, and action areas.  
2. **Classification** – Churn predictions, churn drivers, and feature importance.  
3. **Survival** – Survival curves, cumulative hazard plots, and survival metrics.  
4. **Recommendations** – Customer-level churn & survival predictions with tailored recommendations.

##  Features  
- Upload customer data in **CSV format**  
- Get **real-time predictions** from pre-trained models  
- Visualize churn drivers and survival metrics  
- Generate **customer-specific recommendations**  
- Scalable architecture, ready for cloud deployment
